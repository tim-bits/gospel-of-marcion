The text is divided into 6 sections, each referenced to parallel chapters in the Gospel of Luke as follows:

###### Section I     (Luke 3:1-7:50)
###### Section II    (Luke 8:1-10:24)
###### Section III   (Luke 10:25-13:17)
###### Section IV    (Luke 13:18-17:37)
###### Section V     (Luke 18:1-21:38)
###### Section VI    (Luke 22:1-24:47)

The text is based on *"The Gospel of the Lord"* by James Hamlyn Hill (1891), which made use of the 1823 reconstruction by August Hahn. This current version is further revised by Daniel Mahar to reflect the reconstruction done by Theodor Zahn *("History of the New Testament Canon", vol.II., 1888)*, which places in doubt some of the material Hahn and Hill allowed into their versions.

The text omitted by Zahn can be switched on and off, using ```'Show verses omitted by Zahn'``` toggle in the drawer menu. 
When toggle  is on, the text is displayed in italic and has different color than the rest of the text (i.e. blue in the light mode and yellow in the dark mode).
